    "__Machine learning__ is the field that gives to computers the ability to learn without being explicity programed (Arthur Samuel 1959). More modern definition is *\"A computer program is said to learn form experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its pereformance at tasks in T, as measured by P improves with experience E\"(Tom Mitchell 1998)*.\n",

    "* __Supervised learning__ : The computer is given a certain number of pairs  input/output, by a \"teacher\", with the objective to find a general rule that allows to predict the output of a given input\n",
    "* __Unsupervised learning__ : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end\n",
    "* __Reinforcement learning__ : The program runs in a dynamic enviroment in which it has to perform a certian goal (win a game, drive a car...) The program is given rewards in terms of rewards or punishements while he navigates in the problem space.\n",

    "Another categorization of machine learning tasks arises when one considers the *desired output* of a machine-learned system:\n",
    "* __Classification__ : a process that identifyis to which set of categories a certain in put is more likely to be part of. Exemple classification Brest cancer.\n",
